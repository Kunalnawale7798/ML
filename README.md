1. Predict the price of the Uber ride from a given pickup point to the agreed drop-off location.
      Perform following tasks:
      1. Pre-process the dataset.
      2. Identify outliers.
      3. Check the correlation.
      4. Implement linear regression and random forest regression models.
      5. Evaluate the models and compare their respective scores like R2, RMSE, etc.

2. Classify the email using the binary classification method. Email Spam detection has two 
      states: a) Normal State – Not Spam, b) Abnormal State – Spam. Use K-Nearest Neighbors and 
      Support Vector Machine for classification. Analyze their performance.

3. Implement K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm on diabetes.csv dataset. Compute confusion 
      matrix, accuracy, error rate, precision and recall on the given dataset.
